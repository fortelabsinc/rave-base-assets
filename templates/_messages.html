Template: Flash Messages

Description: Retrieves flashed messages from the session and displays them as alert messages. It's generally used to
provide feedback or notifications to the user. This template is included in the 'page_util_layout.html' template, which
serves as the base content for all web pages.

This code retrieves flashed messages from the session using the `get_flashed_messages()` function with the
`with_categories=true` parameter. This function is provided by Flask's message flashing mechanism. Please refer to the
documentation at https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.0.x/patterns/flashing/ for further information.

If there are any flashed messages, this code iterates over them and displays each message within an appropriate alert
container, whose CSS class is determined based on the message's category. This allows for styling differentiation of
different types of messages (e.g., success, error, warning).

Note: For customization or adjustment of the alert styling, please refer to the CSS stylesheets and classes used in the
'page_util_layout.html' template.
